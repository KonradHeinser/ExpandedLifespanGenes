Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

Make the phrase "they grow up so fast" a reality, or a complete lie, by using one of the 12 new genes this mod adds, 6 that affect the pawn throughout their entire life, and 6 that only impact the child while they are under 18 years old. Each gene alters aging rates by 30%, 60%, and 90%, and it also adds children learning rate multipliers equal to the children aging multiplier to ensure growth moments will not be unfairly lost due to accelerated aging.

This mod will eventually be put into Expanded Biotech Style Genes - All in One. If that mod exists and you still see this message, please let me know I forgot to add the link here.
